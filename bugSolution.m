The primary issue lies in how `myString` is managed.  If the string's lifecycle isn't managed correctly it could cause issues. A proper solution would involve using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting), which simplifies memory management significantly. However, if ARC is not used, manual memory management must be precise.

Here's the corrected code using ARC:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
// dealloc is no longer needed with ARC
@end

// ...in some other method...
MyClass *myObject = [[MyClass alloc] init];
myObject.myString = @"Hello, world!"; // No need for alloc/init with ARC
[myObject release]; // needed if not using ARC

```

If you're not using ARC, then manual retain/release counts must balance correctly.  For example, if you manually allocate `myString`, you must also manually release it in `dealloc`.  Always ensure proper pairing to prevent memory leaks or premature deallocations.

In addition, using properties with proper memory management attributes is essential. Using `strong` (in ARC) or `retain` (in non-ARC) ensures that your object keeps a reference to the string. Using `weak` or `assign` would change the handling of the property and could lead to issues if not managed properly.
